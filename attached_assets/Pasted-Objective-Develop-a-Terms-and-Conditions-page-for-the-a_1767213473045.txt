Objective
Develop a Terms and Conditions page for the application, improve the design of the welcome user section, and implement random user avatars.

Features to Implement
Terms and Conditions Rules and Page
Create a Terms and Conditions page that outlines the user agreement and regulations, focused on:
User responsibilities
Investment guidelines
Withdrawal policies
Data usage and privacy
Any other relevant legal terms discussed in previous chats
Ensure the T&C page is easily accessible from the Profile section and other relevant areas within the app.
Welcome User Section Design
Redesign the welcome user section on the main page to enhance visual appeal and user engagement:
Include a prominent display of the user's avatar.
Consider adding a personalized greeting (e.g., "Welcome, [User's Name]!").
Ensure the layout is clean, modern, and visually inviting, possibly incorporating elements like background images or highlights.
Random User Avatar Assignment
Implement a feature that assigns a random avatar to users upon registration or initial login:
Create a selection of diverse and appealing avatars for users to choose from.
Ensure users can change their avatars later within the Profile section if desired.
Randomly select an avatar from the available set and display it alongside the user’s name in the welcome section.
User Experience Considerations
Gather user feedback on the clarity and comprehensiveness of the Terms and Conditions page.
Conduct usability testing for the redesigned welcome section to confirm it meets user expectations and is visually appealing.
Quality Assurance
Test the Terms and Conditions page for functionality and readability across different devices.
Ensure that the welcome section displays correctly with the random avatar assignment and greeting.

A comprehensive Terms and Conditions page.
A redesigned welcome user section featuring user avatars and personalized greetings.
