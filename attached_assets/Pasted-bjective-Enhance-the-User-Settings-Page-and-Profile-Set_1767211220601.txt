Enhance the User Settings Page and Profile Settings to provide an optimal user experience, ensuring intuitive navigation, clarity, and overall usability.

UX Improvements to Implement
Redesign Layout
Create a clean, organized layout with clear sections for different settings (Profile, Account, Privacy).
Utilize consistent spacing, margins, and alignment to make the interface visually appealing.
Intuitive Navigation
Implement a tabbed navigation or a side menu for quick access to various settings:
Profile Information
Account Settings
Privacy and Security
Terms and Conditions
Ensure that users can easily return to the main settings page without excessive backtracking.
Profile Settings
Improve the usability of editing options:
Streamline the username and phone number change processes with inline validation.
Use progressive disclosure to show advanced settings only when needed (e.g., wallet number options).
Provide contextual help or tooltips for each input field to clarify any requirements.
Feedback Mechanisms
Incorporate clear feedback messages for user actions (e.g., “Profile updated successfully,” or “Please verify your phone number”).
Use visual indicators (like loading spinners) during any background processes (e.g., data loading, saving changes).
Accessibility Considerations
Ensure that the settings page is fully accessible, including appropriate contrast ratios, font sizes, and alternative text for images.
Include navigational enhancements for keyboard users and screen readers.
Consistent Branding and Design
Align the settings page design with the overall branding of the app, using consistent color schemes, fonts, and buttons.
Ensure icons and buttons are easily recognizable and provide visual feedback on interaction.
Testing and Iteration
Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback on the new design.
Iterate based on user feedback to address any lingering pain points.
Deliverables
A redesigned User Settings Page and Profile Settings feature that improves the overall user experience, along with documentation outlining design decisions and user feedback collected during testing.
